# React Dashboard – Milestone 1

This is a basic client-side dashboard layout built using **React**, **React Router**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It’s part of a milestone task to scaffold the navigational shell of a dashboard application.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ React routing with `react-router-dom`
- ✅ Three core sections:
  - `/` or `/dashboard` – Main overview
  - `/transactions` – Transactions page
  - `/settings` – Settings placeholder
- ✅ Simple top navigation bar
- ✅ Tailwind CSS for styling
- ✅ Clean, beginner-friendly structure

---

## 🧠 Purpose

The goal of this milestone is to:

- Set up page routing in a React app
- Establish the layout structure early
- Allow users to navigate between defined sections, even before final UI and data is implemented
